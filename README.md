# Refactoring

## The Starting Point
The first example from the [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) book by Martin Fowler.

This serves as the introduction on how to do refactoring and is the platform for introducing some commons refactorings e.g. Extract Function, Replace Temp with Query, Inline Variable, Change Function Declaration and others.
